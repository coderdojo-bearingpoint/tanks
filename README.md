# tanks

This project is a LÖVE 2D example of a moving tank.

Features:

- Rendering graphics
- Keyboard handling
- Playing sounds

To run this example, install [Lua](http://www.lua.org/download.html) and [LÖVE 2D](https://www.love2d.org/) framework.

Open a command prompt and execute `love <tanks_path>` where `tanks_path` is the path where you downloaded this example.

Alternatively you can compress the example folder into a ZIP file and change the file extension from `.zip` into `.love`, then you just double-click the file to open the example. The ZIP file should contain only the contents of the folder and not the folder itself.

Once running you can use these keys:

- Cursor keys to rotate and move the tank around the screen.
- `A` and `D` keys to rotate the turret.
- `Space` to shoot the gun (no bullets yet I'm afraid)
- `Escape` to quit the game

This can be the start of a great game ... clone this repo and make it yours!
Have fun!
